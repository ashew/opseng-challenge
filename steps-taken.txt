Steps I've taken:

Found an appropriate AMI running Ubuntu 14.04 x64 - ami-7b386c11 (Default is HVM, t1.micro requires paravirtualization so I had to go hunting)
Created new VPC - vpc-0cbe6f6b
Created new subnet - subnet-dddef6ab
Created Internet Gateway - igw-e8afd68c
Attached IGW to VPC, updated route table rtb-08dd8e6f to include default route via attached IGW
Updated sg-ee6ada95 to allow port 80 from everywhere, 22 from my home
Spun up instance

Installed chef (for chef-solo), disabled chef-client

apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential gunicorn nginx git gcc
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install 'Flask==0.10.1'

Created basic flask hello world init file, wsgi wrapper
Configured gunicorn to use the app's wsgi wrapper
Configured nginx to proxy_pass to gunicorn
Confirmed I can view Hello World from home PC and phone (outside my home network)
